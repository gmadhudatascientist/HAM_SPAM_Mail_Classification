This is a PoC project.The goal of the project
is to classify the mail is HAM or SPAM. We tried different classifiers
but finally we found that Nive bayes algorithm is giving good accuracy compared to all models.
Steps involved to solve this problem:
1.Import the libraries
2.Load the dataset
3.clean the data
4.load the custom built Stopwords
5.splitting data into train and test data sets 
6.Learning Term weighting and normalizing on entire emails
7.Preparing a naive bayes model on training data set 
8.Predict the results of train and test datasets
9.Training and Test Data accuracy

Finally we got test data accuracy is 96% and train data accuracy is 96%
So finally proved that this model is giving best accuracy.
